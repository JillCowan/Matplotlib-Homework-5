# Pymaceuticals- A hypothetical drug trial data analysis project

![Laboratory](Laboratory.jpg)

For this project, we were asked to assume the role of a data analyst from hypothetical pharmaceutical company, Pymaceuticals Inc.  Pymaceuticals specializes in drug-based, anti-cancer pharmaceuticals. In their most recent efforts, they've since begun screening for potential treatments to squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), a commonly occurring form of skin cancer.

We've been given access to the complete data from their most recent animal study. In this study, 250 mice were treated through a variety of drug regimes over the course of 45 days. Their physiological responses were then monitored over the course of that time. Our objective was to analyze the data to show how four treatments (Capomulin, Infubinol, Ketapril, and Placebo) compare.

The data files were read and manipulated using Pandas and subsequently plotted with Matplotlib. Four different plots were constructed:
  a scatter plot that shows how the tumor volume changes over time for each treatment,
  a scatter plot that shows how the number of metastatic (cancer spreading) sites changes over time for each treatment,
  a scatter plot that shows the number of mice still alive through the course of treatment (Survival Rate),
  a bar graph that compares the total % tumor volume change for each drug across the full 45 days.
  
The results are displayed on a webpage using HTML, CSS and Bootstrap.
